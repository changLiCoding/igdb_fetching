Veteran players, as well as those who missed out when the original game was first released on PC twenty years ago, can now experience Diablo II’s timeless gameplay with modern visuals and audio that take advantage of today’s gaming hardware. Ascend the Forgotten Tower, blaze a trail through the jungles of Kurast, and storm the gates of Hell to defeat Diablo himself. Then, scale the peak of Mount Arreat to face Baal, the Lord of Destruction, in Worldstone Keep. Seven of Sanctuary’s greatest champions await at the iconic campfire screen—the Amazon, Assassin, Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Paladin, and Sorceress. Each is highly customizable with countless build and gear options for players to explore.\n\nDiablo II: Resurrected can be played as a solo experience, or grab some friends on Nintendo Switch and enjoy multiplayer co-op. Then blow off some steam and claim a few ears by engaging in thrilling PvP duels outside of town. Find your way back to New Tristram in Diablo III: Eternal Collection, 20 years following the events in Diablo II: Resurrected. Return to where it all began and investigate rumors of a fallen star: the first sign of evil's rebirth, and an omen that the End Times have begun.…",
